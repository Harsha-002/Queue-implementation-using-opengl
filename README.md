# Queue-implementation-using-opengl
This project explains the implementation of Queue using a different shapes as an element. The queue is a data structure which works on FIFO (First In First Out) technique. The elements are inserted as elements by assigning color and side to each element. Elements will be placed one above another by keeping first inserted triangle at the bottom and the successive elements on top of it. When Delete operation is selected using mouse button the elements from the front end will be taken out first from the Queue. By using various OpenGL functions the project has been implemented.
